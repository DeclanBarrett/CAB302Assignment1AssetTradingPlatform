# CAB302Assignment1AssetTradingPlatform
Our goal is the create a fully functioning electronic trading system for the trading of assets in the “Unnamed Views Corporation” business, so that the internal organisations can gather the assets they need, sell the assets they have in excess, and be limited by the credits that they are allowed to use.

Users will be given access to Buy and Sell features and interact with a GUI to perform these trades. This GUI will not give them access to all the features system administrators will have.
